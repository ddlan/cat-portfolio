          Originally, I was a Program Manager intern on the Adobe Digital Experience (DX) Credentialing team. My primary objective was to house projects to increase and retain the number of accredited individuals. <Orange>However, after conducting user research, I identified an opportunity for our program to vastly surpass our target KPIs.</Orange>
          <br /><br />
          {/* eslint-disable-next-line max-len */}
          While we had credentialing programs, we did not offer training nor continuous learning, which was of high-demand from our users.
          <br /><br />
          {/* eslint-disable-next-line max-len */}
          After pitching this idea and gaining my team’s endorsement, I embarked on the goal of designing a scalable Adobe DX training program addressing our retention and net-new acquisition goals and integrating it effectively with our current certification programs.<br />
